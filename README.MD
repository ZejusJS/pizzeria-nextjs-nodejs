# Mamma mia
first project with nextjs + nodejs

### To-do list:
1. Completly rebuild auth with JWT for easier accessing basic info of user
2. Repair checkout page, so it will fetch cart from query
3. Do middlewares in backend for checking cart's user
4. Learn how payment gateway works
5. Implement sandbox gateway (maybe from ÄŒSOB)
6. Try implement Google auth
